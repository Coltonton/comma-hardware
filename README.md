# Comma-Hardware
Repo for ALL the comma hardware, new, old, released, & reverse engineered!

----

## Comma-Released Folder:
This folder contains all the files publicly released and Open-Sourced by Comma.ai and is a mirror of [comma/neo](https://github.com/commaai/neo) on github with changes to the folder names for clarity all these files were created by Comma.ai and community members as well, see [https://github.com/commaai/neo](https://github.com/commaai/neo) for more. This is just a backup of those files to have, and also just in case Comma decides to delete anything "because its not relevent" or any other reason.

## Community Reverse Engineering Effort:
- In Progress comma ;)
